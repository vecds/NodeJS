HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language.
HTML is used to create web pages and web applications.
HTML is widely used language on the web.
We can create a static website by HTML only.
HTML was first created by Tim Berners-Lee, Robert Cailliau, and others starting in 1989.
Technically, HTML is a Markup language rather than a programming language.
Hypertext means that the document contains links that allow the reader to jump to other places in the 
document or to another document altogether. 
A markup language is a system of symbols that defines the structure and formatting of a document.
It uses tags to mark up elements within a document, such as headings, paragraphs, and concepts.
The latest version is known as HTML5.
Tags and attributes are the basis of HTML.

EXAMPLE:-
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>This is a Heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>
<!DOCTYPE html> — This tag specifies the language you will write on the page. In this case, the language is HTML 5.
<html> — This tag signals that from here on we are going to write in HTML code.
<head> — This is where all the metadata for the page goes — stuff mostly meant for search engines and other computer programs.
<body> — This is where the content of the page goes.

Web browsers render and display web pages based on the HTML tags in their code. 
Here's how web pages read HTML tags:

Parsing: When a web browser loads a webpage, it starts by parsing the HTML code. 
        Parsing analyzes the HTML document and creates a structured representation of its contents, 
        known as the Document Object Model (DOM).
DOM Tree: The DOM tree represents the hierarchical structure of HTML elements, 
        where each element is represented as a node with properties and attributes. 
        The browser constructs the DOM tree by interpreting the HTML tags and their relationships, 
        such as parent-child and sibling elements.
Rendering: Once the DOM tree is constructed, the browser uses it to render the webpage on the screen. 
        Rendering involves applying CSS styles, calculating layout, and painting pixels based on the 
        content and properties of HTML elements.
Event Handling: Web browsers also handle user interactions and dynamic content updates based on JavaScript 
        code associated with HTML elements. Event listeners attached to HTML tags respond to user actions 
        such as clicks, mouse movements, and keyboard inputs.
