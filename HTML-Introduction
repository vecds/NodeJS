HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language.
HTML is used to create web pages and web applications.
HTML is widely used language on the web.
We can create a static website by HTML only.
HTML was first created by Tim Berners-Lee, Robert Cailliau, and others starting in 1989.
Technically, HTML is a Markup language rather than a programming language.
Hypertext means that the document contains links that allow the reader to jump to other places in the 
document or to another document altogether. 
A markup language is a system of symbols that defines the structure and formatting of a document.
It uses tags to mark up elements within a document, such as headings, paragraphs, and concepts.
The latest version is known as HTML5.
Tags and attributes are the basis of HTML.

EXAMPLE:-
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>This is a Heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>
<!DOCTYPE html> — This tag specifies the language you will write on the page. In this case, the language is HTML 5.
<html> — This tag signals that from here on we are going to write in HTML code.
<head> — This is where all the metadata for the page goes — stuff mostly meant for search engines and other computer programs.
<body> — This is where the content of the page goes.
