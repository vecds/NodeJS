Nodejs

~Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment and 
  library for running web applications outside the client's browser. 
~Ryan Dahl developed it in 2009, and its latest iteration, version 15.14, 
  was released in April 2021. 
~Developers use Node.js to create server-side web applications, and it is perfect 
  for data-intensive applications since it uses an asynchronous, event-driven model.
There are more than 50,000 bundles available in the Node Package Manager and for that
  reason developers can import any of the packages any time according to their needed 
  functionality for which a lot of time is saved.

Features of NodeJs
Asynchronous in Nature and Event driven:
    The servers made with the NodeJs never waits for the from an API. Without waiting for
    the data from the API, it directly moves to the next API. So all the APIs of NodeJS are totally non-blocking in nature.
Single Threaded Architecture:
    With event looping, a single threaded architecture is followed by NodeJs and for this architecture makes NodeJs more scalable.
Scalable:
    NodeJs is that it can partition the applications horizontally and this partition procedure is mainly achieved by
    it due to the use of child processes.
Quick Execution Time for Code:
    V8 JavaScript runtime motor is used by NodeJs and this is also used by Google chrome. 
Compatibility on the Cross Platforms:
Different types of systems like Windows, UNIX, LINUX, MacOS and other mobile devices can use NodeJs. 

Applications of Node.js
Web Servers,Real-Time Applications,APIs and Microservices,Single-Page Applications (SPAs),Streaming Applications,Internet of Things (IoT).

in 2025, there are 15+ popular companies who are using NodeJs .

Companies like NASA, Trello, Netflix, PayPal, LinkedIn, Walmart, Uber, Twitter, Yahoo, eBay, GoDaddy etc are using NodeJs.

Installation of NodeJS and NPM:

Installation of NodeJS and NPM is straightforward using the installer package available at NodeJS official web site.

Download the installer from NodeJS WebSite.
Run the installer.
Follow the installer steps, agree the license agreement and click the next button.

Now, test NodeJS by printing its version using the following command in Command Prompt:

> node -v

and test npm by printing its version using command

> npm -v

Simple way to test nodeJS work in your system is to create a javascript file which print a message.

Lets create test.js file

/*test.js file*/
console.log("Node is working");

Run the test.js file using Node command > node test.js in command prompt.

>node test.js
OUTPUT:


Node Package Module
NPM is the package module which helps javascript developers load dependencies effectively. 
To load dependencies we just have to run a command in command prompt:

> npm install

This command is finding a json file named as package.json in root directory to install all dependencies defined in the file.

Basic Example
Create a server.js javascript file with following code

/*server.js*/

const http = require('http');

const hostname = '127.0.0.1';
const port = 3000;

const server = http.createServer(function(req, res) {
  res.statusCode = 200;
  res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain');
  res.end('Hello World\n');
});

server.listen(port, hostname, function() {
  console.log('Server running at http://'+ hostname + ':' + port + '/');
});

Now Run server.js file un node using command

> node server
Open a browser and enter url https://127.0.0.1:3000/. The browser will display Hello World message on the screen.
