4.	Explore the features of ES6 like arrow functions, callbacks, promises, async/await. 
    Implement an application for reading the weather information from openweathermap.org and 
    display the information in the form of a graph on the webpage.

JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995, and became an ECMA standard in 1997.

ECMAScript is the official name of the language.

ECMAScript versions have been abbreviated to ES1, ES2, ES3, ES5, and ES6.

Since 2016, versions are named by year (ECMAScript 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020).

ECMAScript 2015 was the second major revision to JavaScript.

ECMAScript 2015 is also known as ES6 and ECMAScript 6.

New Features in ES6
The let keyword
The const keyword
Arrow Functions

The let keyword allows you to declare a variable with block scope.

Example:
var x = 10;
// Here x is 10
{
  let x = 2;
  // Here x is 2
}
// Here x is 10

JavaScript const:
The const keyword allows you to declare a constant (a JavaScript variable with a constant value).

Constants are similar to let variables, except that the value cannot be changed.

Example
var x = 10;
// Here x is 10
{
  const x = 2;
  // Here x is 2
}
// Here x is 10


Arrow Functions:
Arrow functions allows a short syntax for writing function expressions.

You don't need the function keyword, the return keyword, and the curly brackets.

Example
// ES5
var x = function(x, y) {
   return x * y;
}

// ES6
const x = (x, y) => x * y;

Callbacks:
  JavaScript functions are executed in the sequence they are called. Not in the sequence they are defined.

  This example will end up displaying "Goodbye":

Example
function myFirst() {
  myDisplayer("Hello");
}

function mySecond() {
  myDisplayer("Goodbye");
}
myFirst();
mySecond();

Promices:
  A promise in JavaScript is like a container for a future value. It is a way of saying, 
  “I don’t have this value right now, but I will have it later.”

  a promise lets you keep working with your code while waiting for something else to finish, 
  like loading data from a server. When the data is ready, the promise will deliver it.

  A promise can be in one of three states:

  Pending: The promise is waiting for something to finish. For example, waiting for data to load from a website.
  Fulfilled: The promise has been completed successfully. The data you were waiting for is now available.
  Rejected: The promise has failed. Maybe there was a problem, like the server not responding.

  When you create a promise, you write some code that will eventually tell the promise whether it was successful 
  (fulfilled) or not (rejected).
  Syntax:
  let promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject){
     //do something
    });

  let myPromise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
  // some code that takes time, like loading data
  let success = true; // change this to false to check error

  if (success) {
    resolve("The data has loaded successfully!");
  } else {
    reject("There was an error loading the data.");
  }
  });

let promise = new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
    const x = "VAAGDEVIAN";
    const y = "VAAGDEVIAN"
    if (x === y) {
        resolve();
    } else {
        reject();
    }
  });

promise.
    then(function () {
        console.log('Success, You are a Vaagdevian');
    }).
    catch(function () {
        console.log('Some error has occurred');
    });
